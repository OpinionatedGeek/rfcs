# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Serum Automated Market Maker (SAMM) - a constant-product market making bot for [Serum](https://projectserum.com/) exchanges.

SAMM is:

* An automated market-making bot,
* That anyone can run,
* That targets a specified Serum market (lightweight containers can run simultaneously, supporting multiple markets),
* That provides post-only orders for both sides of the market (both bid and ask),
* That uses a constant-product function (similar to [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), but with some essential changes) to calculate the price for bids and asks.


# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Constant-product liquidity pools like Uniswap do a great job being both a source and destination of liquidity. The more liquidity the pool has, the tighter the spreads it can offer, which can become self-reinforcing - attracting more liquidity, leading to tighter spreads.

However, this tends to lead to a lot of concentration in a few pools, which in turn leads to limiting possible configurations - popular configurations will have their profit spread over more pool contributors, less popular configurations will have smaller pools (and thus wider spreads) leading to fewer filled orders and less profit.

SAMM can be configured and run to provide a constant-product AMM on Serum on the same grand scale as Uniswap. But it can also scale down to an individual running a custom version of it too. Liquidity pools typically canâ€™t do that.

This has a number of benefits.


## Scalability
[scalability]: #scalability

Uniswap-like approaches default to a single risk model - the liquidity used to calculate the constant-product is also the liqudity used to fulfill the orders. That makes perfect sense for liquidity pools, but what if you want to take a different approach. What if you want to be able to say "assume I have this much liquidity" when calculating the constant product, but fulfill the orders from a much smaller pot. This takes on more risk, but could be a viable strategy for individuals who donâ€™t have enough to otherwise effectively operate a constant-product AMM. By abstracting the code and the balances, SAMM could scale up to work on a huge pool of liquidity (especially when liquidity pool primitives come along) with a normal constant-product function or down to a single user running a single instance taking on higher risk with lower liquidity.


## Configurability
[configurability]: #configurability

Uniswap charges a 0.3% fee. What if you want to be more aggressive and use a 0.1% fee? Or think youâ€™ll make more money with a 0.5% fee? There are some liquidity pools that compete with Uniswap on fees, but youâ€™re dependent on these other huge liquidity pools to provide a configuration that matches what you want. If your risk model and approach mean you want tiers at, say 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.25%, 0.275%, 0.3%, 0.325%, 0.35%, youâ€™ll have difficulty finding liquidity pools that match what you want, and if you do find them youâ€™ll find they all have inconsistent spreads because of the constant-product function working on different liquidity pool sizes. To implement those tiers using SAMM is just a matter of configuring and running 7 container instances.


## Control
[control]: #control

_â€˜Not your keys, not your coinsâ€™_ is a common refrain. A typical liquidity pool involves putting your funds in an account not under your own direct control, with open-source code and audits usually providing some level of confidence in their custody.

SAMM can be as non-custodial as Serum. SAMM, by default, will create a new account for you, but youâ€™ll have the mnemonic seed words and no-one else will. (And you can just put your own accountâ€™s mnemonic seed words in instead of having SAMM create the account.)

There are still the issues of running someone elseâ€™s code against your funds, but thereâ€™s maybe less risk if the entire account the funds reside in is under your own control. (Maybe not. Bugs and fraud are huge risks in both cases.)


## Extensibility
[extensibility]: #extensibility

Liquidity pools are typically also really hard to extend. Letâ€™s say you come up with a â€˜betterâ€™ constant-product function. (Or something.) Now what? You can change the liquidity poolâ€™s code and run it, but couldnâ€™t replace the service itself, and you canâ€™t effectively run that code as a service without the enormous liquidity liquidity pool youâ€™re replacing already has. Itâ€™s not that the liquidity poolâ€™s code is harder to change, itâ€™s that even with perfectly-changed code replacing that service (and getting sufficient liquidity) is a huge barrier.


# Design

## Overview
[overview]: #overview

SAMM places a buy post-only order and a sell post-only order on a Serum market. Every `pollInterval` (30 seconds by default), SAMM checks to see if either order has been filled. If they havenâ€™t, it does nothing.

If an order has been filled:
1. **The other order is cancelled.** Itâ€™s possible - although unlikely - that both orders were filled and there are no orders to cancel.
2. **The new balances are assessed,** Since an order has been filled, the balances will have changed - some of the `base` will have been traded for some of the `quote`, or some of the `quote` will have been traded for some of the `base`. SAMM needs the updated balances for the constant product calculation.
3. **New prices are calculated.** The constant product calculation determines what â€˜fairâ€™ price should be charged for portion of the `base` or `quote` token.
4. **New orders are built.** Once SAMM has the new prices and sizes, it does a few extra checks. For instance, it checks that the price is the right side of the spread. If a spread is `Â« lowprice / highprice Â»`, SAMM will never try to sell lower than the `lowprice`, nor buy higher than the `highprice`. In those cases SAMM shifts the price so that it is within the spread. SAMM also checks to ensure it has sufficient tokens for the size of the order, since some parameters can lead to odd situations.
5. **The new orders are placed.** Thereâ€™s nothing more interesting to describe about this bit.

SAMM then sleeps for another `pollInterval` and this process then repeats.


# Interface
[interface]: #interface

The market maker is a background service so presents no user interface itself. A number of commands are provided for managing associated accounts and orders.

## ðŸ“œ Commands

The following commands are available:

* [balance](#command-balance)
* [cancel-orders](#command-cancel-orders)
* [create-wallet](#command-create-wallet)
* [events](#command-events)
* [fills](#command-fills)
* [init-market](#command-init-market)
* [make-market](#command-make-market)
* [openorders](#command-openorders)
* [orderbook](#command-orderbook)
* [orders](#command-orders)
* [pricing](#command-pricing)
* [rebalance](#command-rebalance)
* [settle](#command-settle)
* [spread](#command-spread)

### âš¡ Command: balance

The balance command reports on the SOL balance of the wallet account (both settled and unsettled), and optionally the balance of the SPL tokens in market accounts.

It also tries to give a â€˜notionalâ€™ value for the market account by calculating how much the current â€˜baseâ€™ balance is in â€˜quoteâ€™ terms. For example, in the ETH/USDT market it calculates a total of how much USDT there is plus how much the ETH is worth in USDT terms (calculated using the best bid price).

#### Parameters

* `--market <market-name>` Specifies the market to be used. (Optional)

#### Example Use
```
$ /var/sammd/bin/samm balance --market ETH/USDT
2020-10-01T17:12:40.453Z ðŸ“„ Solana:                    1.97224368 SOL

### âš¡ Command: orders

Prints out a summary of any open orders you have in the specified market.

#### Parameters

* `--market <market-name>` Specifies the market to be used. (Required)

#### Example Use

### âš¡ Command: pricing

Prints out pricing information for the specified market, based on your current balances and the current orderbook. (You can see the implied pricing from balances is quite different from the current spread pricing - this generally shouldnâ€™t be the case and is a warning sign, and maybe an opportunity to use the `rebalance` command.)

### âš¡ Command: rebalance

If youâ€™re just setting things up or if token balances have shifted, the `rebalance` command will try to place an order to buy or sell tokens to move the ratio of balances back towards the current live spread.

It wonâ€™t be exact but it aims to get balances back to where the constant-product function will be self-correcting.

It takes a `--dryRun` parameter to enable you to run this safely without it actually placing the order. Itâ€™s often best to try a dry run before running this command for real.

#### Parameters

* `--market <market-name>` Specifies the market to be used. (Required)
* `--dryRun` If specified, run but donâ€™t place any orders. (Optional. Default: unspecified)
* `--useMidPrice` If specified, uses the mid price instead of the best bid price (for a buy) or the best ask price (for a sell). (Optional. Default: unspecified)

#### Example Use

```

### âš¡ Command: settle

When an order is placed, tokens are taken from your SPL token account and locked away. When the order is filled, those tokens are removed and replaced by the tokens you just bought or sold. Those tokens are yours, but theyâ€™re not yet in your SPL token account. Moving them from this transactional area to your SPL token account is called â€˜settlingâ€™, and thatâ€™s what the `settle` command does.

You can see this in action when the `balances` command tells you how many tokens you have, and how many of those are â€˜unsettledâ€™. If you see an â€˜unsettledâ€™ balance and you have no open orders locking those tokens, you can use this command to move the tokens to your SPL token accounts.

#### Parameters

* `--asynchronous` If specified, sends the settle transaction but does not wait for confirmations. If unspecified, waits for the transaction to receive `--confirmations` confirmations. (Optional. Default: unspecified)
* `--confirmations <confirmations>` Specifies the number of confirmations to wait if running synchronously (i.e. `--asynchronous` is unspecified). (Optional. Default: 6)
* `--dryRun` If specified, run but donâ€™t place any orders. (Optional. Default: unspecified)
* `--market <market-name>` Specifies the market to be used. (Required)

#### Example Use

### âš¡ Command: spread

Prints out the current spread from the live orderbook for the specified market.

#### Parameters

* `--market <market-name>` Specifies the market to be used. (Required)

#### Example Use

# Rationale and Alternatives

## No on-chain programs

The necessity to periodically check existing orders and add fresh ones rules out any â€˜pureâ€™ on-chain approach. _Something_ needs to initiate the check, and that is typically done by some off-chain event (like the â€˜crankâ€™). It might be possible to substitute an on-chain program for some of the functionality, but that would come at the expense of greatly complicating development and deployment.

## Polling

A constant-product AMM needs to operate consistently and predictably, but not necessarily quickly.

Serum markets are orderbook-driven, and SAMM places post-only orders at specific prices based solely on its balances. Itâ€™s not directly responsive to new information or price shifts - all that matters to SAMM are orders being filled and changes in balances. When an order is filled, SAMM calculates new prices for the next buy and sell orders, but the price on those orders will likely be a distance away from the current price. Itâ€™ll take a while for the price to shift enough for either the new buy or sell price to be hit.

It would be possible to achieve faster reactions to events by streaming transactions directly from a Solana websocket, but this introduces a lot more code and complexity but doesnâ€™t seem to provide any significant advantages.


## Containerization

Itâ€™s not _necessary_ for the AMM to run as a container, but running it as a container provides many advantages, from consistent dependency management to automatic failover and easily scaling out to new instances for new markets.

## Javascript

Javascript was chosen because it appears to have the best Serum API library. Node as the Javascript platform was then the natural choice.
